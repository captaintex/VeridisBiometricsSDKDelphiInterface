This is a small test unit to access the free Veridis Biometrics SDK (http://www.veridisbiometrics.com) in order to integrate biometric recognition (fingerprints) to your application, with support for readers from various manufacturers.
Veridis offers no support for Delphi developers, and I could not find any reference on the network.
The project is incomplete, as I could not manage to get the image of the fingerprint.
It is written for Delphi 7.

BEFORE YOU CAN USE THE PROJECT:
Veridis SDK is available from http://www.veridisbiometrics.com/index.php/produtos/biometric-sdk-free
You will need to register for a free license from http://www.veridisbiometrics.com/index.php/produtos/account/login
